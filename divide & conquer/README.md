# Divide & Conquer

Broadly, we can understand divide-and-conquer approach in a three-step process.

Divide/Break
This step involves breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems. Sub-problems should
represent a part of the original problem. This step generally takes a recursive approach 
to divide the problem until no sub-problem is further divisible. At this stage, sub-problems 
become atomic in nature but still represent some part of the actual problem.

Conquer/Solve
This step receives a lot of smaller sub-problems to be solved. Generally, at this level, 
the problems are considered 'solved' on their own.

Merge/Combine
When the smaller sub-problems are solved, this stage recursively combines them until they 
formulate a solution of the original problem. This algorithmic approach works recursively 
and conquer & merge steps works so close that they appear as one.
