# Recursion

Recursion is a method of solving problems that involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller 
subproblems until you get to a small enough problem that it can be solved trivially. Usually recursion 
involves a function calling itself. While it may not seem like much on the surface, recursion allows us 
to write elegant solutions to problems that may otherwise be very difficult to program.


### What is a base condition in recursion?
In a recursive function, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger 
problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.

The role of the base condition is to stop a recursive function from executing endlessly – 
once a pre-specified base condition is met, the function knows it’s time to exit.
