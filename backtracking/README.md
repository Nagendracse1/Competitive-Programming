# Backtracking 

Backtracking is a method to solve problems by making a series   
choices that we can return or backtrack to.   

The call stack "remember &  knows what to choose next.  


3 keys :   
----------------------------------  
1. Our Choices:   
> What choices do we make at each  
call of the function.  
> Recursion expresses decision.  
----------------------------------  
2. Our Constraints  
> When do we stop following a certain path?  
> When do we not even go one way?  
----------------------------------  
3.Our Goal  
> What's our target?  
> What are we trying to find?  
----------------------------------
