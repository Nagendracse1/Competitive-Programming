# Hashing

Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects.
Some examples of how hashing is used in our lives include:

* In universities, each student is assigned a unique roll number that can be used to retrieve information about them.
* In libraries, each book is assigned a unique number that can be used to determine information about the book, such 
  as its exact position in the library or the users it has been issued to etc.
